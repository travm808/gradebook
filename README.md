# gradebook
For this program I created a gradebook in Python. This gradebook utilizes dictionaries to hold the students, their class schedule, and test with grades for each class. The options allow a user to add/remove students, classes and test and their grades, shows all students in the gradebook, shows a student's class schedule, and show test averages.
